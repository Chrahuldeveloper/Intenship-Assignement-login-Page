# Full Stack App – React + Node.js

This project is a full-stack web application consisting of a React frontend and a Node.js (Express) backend.

---

## Frontend – React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

### Available Scripts

In the `app/` directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the React app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.  

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**  
If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time.

## Backend – Node.js + Express

The backend server is located in the `server/` directory.

### Available Scripts

In the `server/` directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Starts the backend server using nodemon for hot reloading.  
Runs on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) by default.

### `npm start`

Runs the backend server without nodemon.
